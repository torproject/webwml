# Tor: Sponsors

The Tor Project's [diversity of users](../about/torusers.html.en) means we
have a diversity of funding sources too -- and we're eager to diversify even
further!

Thank you to all the people and groups who have made Tor possible so far, and
thank you especially to the individual volunteers who have made non-financial
contributions: coding, testing, documenting, educating, researching, and
running the relays that make up the Tor network.
