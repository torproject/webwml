# The Tor Project is looking for a Project Manager!

# Note: we've gotten enough applications for this position for now. Thank you!

A project manager is the person who brings order to chaos. You will coordinate
and help track deliverables, progress, and metrics of current projects. You
will also help plan future projects through proposals.

Your impact will involve:

  * Deriving deliverables, deadlines, and milestones for each active contract.
  * Developing and publishing timelines and schedules for completion of milestones and deliverables for each active, and occasionally proposed, contract.
  * Collecting ideas and potential deliverables for the future.
  * Raising concerns, timeline slips, and probability of missed deadlines to management.
  * Helping with managing people's schedules, work load, and keeping various people or teams in communication with one another.
  * Tracking deliverable completion.
  * Developing and maintaining metrics about project completion rate and other measures as based on [evidence-based project management](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html) or something similar.
  * Helping contractors develop their contract deliverables for six month periods based on expected workload.
  * Maintaining project status pages on trac (or whatever system we have) with deliverables, tickets, and monthly summaries of progress.
  * Helping to write the monthly progress reports required for contracts.

In general, you should:

  * Be comfortable and experienced with interacting with users and other developers online.
  * Be comfortable working remotely.
  * Be comfortable with transparency: as a non-profit, we work in public.
  * Be comfortable and experienced justifying and documenting technical decisions for a public, world-wide technical audience.

An ideal candidate would also:

  * Have experience with open-source software development, including working with distributed teams across different time-zones containing employees and volunteers of differing skill levels over multiple mediums, including email, instant messaging, and IRC.
  * Have experience maintaining long-term software projects. 
  * Have basic familiarity with distributed version control systems.

Other notes:

  * Tor has an office in Cambridge, MA. However, you can work from wherever you want, in basically any country. You'll need to be comfortable in this environment! We coordinate via IRC, Instant Messaging, email, phone and video chats, and bug trackers.
  * Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have the right experience.
  * We only write free and open source software, and we don't believe in software patents.

How to apply:

  * Link to a sample of projects you've coordinated in the past that you're allowed to show us.
  * Provide a CV explaining your background, experience, skills, and other relevant qualifications.
  * List some people who can tell us more about you: these references could be employers or coworkers, open source projects, etc.
  * Email the above to jobs@torproject.org, specifying the "Project Manager" position.
