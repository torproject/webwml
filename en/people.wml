developed by <a href="http://freehaven.net/~arma/">Roger Dingledine</a>
and <a href="http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/">Nick Mathewson</a>, with
help from many volunteers around the Internet.</p>

Haven and <a href="http://www.syverson.org/">Paul Syverson</a> of the
<a href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/">Naval Research Laboratory</a>, based
on the original <a href="http://www.onion-router.net/">onion routing</a>
