    <h1>Tor: Running a Mirror</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Thank you for wanting to mirror the Tor website.  All of
    our mirrors are publicly listed on <a href="<page getinvolved/mirrors>">our mirrors
    page</a>.  We've included some sample commands and configuration below
    to make the initial setup and ongoing maintenance a minimal effort.
    The Tor website and distribution directory currently require roughly
    30 GB of disk space, but this number can fluctuate. Expect space
    requirements of up to 50 GB.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you would like to run a mirror, it's as easy as these commands to download
    everything a mirror should share with the world:
    </p>
    <tt>
<pre>
rsync -aq --exclude dist --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/website-mirror/ /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org
rsync -aq --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/dist-mirror/ /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org/dist
</pre>
    </tt>

    <p>
    In order to assure we have reliable and up to date mirrors,
    please ensure your mirror does at least the following:<br/><br/>

    Updates <b>no less</b> than every six hours, but no more frequent than every
    hour.<br/><br/>

    Allows "Directory Index / Indexes" (Index viewing) of the /dist
    directory.<br/><br/>

    Have a valid contact email for administrative communications should your
    server have issues.<br/><br/>

    It is highly recommended for all mirror operators to subscribe to <A
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors">tor-mirrors mailing
    list</A> where all mirror listing modification requests should go (ADD,
    CHANGE, DELETE, any other requests/notifications).  Also, any technical
    assistance in setting up your mirror may be found here as well.<br/><br/>

    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
    An example cronjob to update a full mirror once every 6 hours may look like so:
    </p>
    <tt>
<pre>
# m h  dom mon dow   command
0 */6 * * * rsync -aq --exclude dist --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/website-mirror/ /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org
5 */6 * * * rsync -aq --delete rsync://rsync.torproject.org/dist-mirror/ /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org/dist
</pre>
    </tt>
    <p>
    For mirror operators that use Apache, we have created a sample virtual host
    configuration file to use:
    </p>
    <tt>
<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost 10.10.10.10:80&gt;
    ServerAdmin youremail@example.com<br/>
    ServerName  ServerNameHere<br/>

    DocumentRoot /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org<br/>

    &lt;Directory /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org/&gt;<br/>
        # Be sure to enable the autoindex and negotiation modules<br/>
        Options MultiViews Indexes<br/>
        DirectoryIndex index<br/>
        AllowOverride None<br/>
    &lt;/Directory&gt;<br/>

&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
    </tt>
    <p>
    For mirror operators that use nginx, we created a sample virtual host
    configuration file to use:
    </p>
    <tt>
<pre>
server {
    listen 10.10.10.10:80;
    server_name your.example.com;

    root /var/www/mirrors/torproject.org;
    index index.html.en;

    location  / {
        autoindex on;
    }
}
</pre>
    </tt>
    <p>
    If you use nginx, please ensure the text/html line in
    <tt>/etc/nginx/mime.types</tt> matches:
    </p>
    <tt>
<pre>
text/html                             en html htm shtml;
</pre>
    </tt>
    <p>
    Please ensure that you keep your mirror updated (we suggest automating this
    task with something like '<tt>cron</tt>'). Our website, source code and
    binary releases change often. An update frequency of six hours is recommended.  Tor users everywhere will thank you.
    </p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#nologging">Prevent logging of IP addresses</a></h2>
    <p>
    To protect the privacy of your users disable logging of IP addresses with
    any of the following methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Apache</strong>:
      Install the module <i>libapache2-mod-removeip</i> or change the CustomLog
      directive to log every user as <i>0.0.0.0</i> which makes it play nicely
      with something like AWstats, or any other log-analysis software:
      <pre>CustomLog /path/to/desired/log/location "0.0.0.0 %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b"</pre>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Nginx</strong>:
      To suppress IP and user information while staying compatible with the
      <a href="https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_log_module.html">Common Log Format</a>,
      and drop the HTTP Referer and User-Agent fields use these lines in your
      <i>nginx.conf</i> (adapt the second line if your log files are not in
      <i>/var/log/nginx</i>):
      <pre>
log_format privacy '- - - [$time_local] "$request" $status $body_bytes_sent';
access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log privacy;
      </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2><a class="anchor" href="#mirrorops">Joining the mirror community</a></h2>
    <p>
    If you are running a mirror, please subscribe to the <A
    href="https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-mirrors">tor-mirrors
    mailing list</A>, and introduce yourself there. Help for mirror
    support and configuration issues may also be found on the list.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to add your mirror, please send a
    single, comma delimited line of text based on <a
    href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/project/web/webwml.git/plain/include/tor-mirrors.csv">this
    file</a> to the mirrors list. Your mirror will then be added manually
    if it passes availability testing and your provided information is
    confirmed. Some general pointers on mirrors are:
    </p>
    <ol><li> Try not to run your mirror behind a content delivery network
    (such as Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, etc) as most of them block
    access from countries where the mirror is needed the most.</li>
    <li> Try not to redirect http to https. Many places in the world
    cannot use https due to local or national firewalls.</li>
    </ol>
