<!-- Intro -->
    <p>Digital signature is a process ensuring that a certain package was
    generated by its developers and has not been tampered with. Below we explain
    why it is important and how to verify that the Tor program you download is
    the one we have created and has not been modified by some attacker.</p>

    <p>If you want to learn more about how it works see<br/>

    <hr>
    <p>
    How do you know that the Tor program you have is really the one we made?
    Digital signatures ensure that the package you are downloading was created
    by our <a href="<>page about/corepeople>">developers</a>. It uses a
    cryptographic mechanism to ensure that the software package that you have
    just downloaded is authentic.

   <article class="ac-small">

    <p>
    For many Tor users it is important to verify that the Tor software is
    authentic as they have very real adversaries who might try to give them a
    fake version of Tor.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the Tor package has been modified by some attacker it is not safe to use
    it. It doesn't matter how secure and anonymous Tor is if you're not running
    the real Tor.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before you go ahead and download something, there are a few extra steps you
    should take to make sure you have downloaded an authentic version of Tor.
    </p>

    <h4>Always download Tor from torproject.org</h4>

    <p>
    There are a variety of attacks that can be used to make you download a fake
    version of Tor. For example, an attacker could trick you into thinking some
    other website is a great place to download Tor. You should always download
    Tor from
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org"><b>https</b>://www.torproject.org/</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Always make sure you are browsing over https</h4>

    <p>
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org">https://www.torproject.org/</a> uses
    https. Https is the secure version of the http protocol which uses
    encryption and authentication between your browser and the website.
    This makes it much harder for the attacker to modify your download. But
    it's not perfect. Some places in the world block the Tor website, making
    users to download Tor <a href="<page docs/faq>#GetTor">somewhere else</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Large companies sometimes force employees to use a modified browser,
    so the company can listen in on all their browsing. We've even
    <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/diginotar-debacle-and-what-you-should-do-about-it">seen</a>
    attackers who have the ability to trick your browser into thinking
    you're talking to the Tor website with https when you're not.
    </p>

    <h4>Always verify signatures of packages you have downloaded</h4>

    <p>
    Some software sites list
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">sha1
    hashes</a> alongside the software on their website, so users can
    verify that they downloaded the file without any errors. These
    "checksums" help you answer the question "Did I download this file
    correctly from whoever sent it to me?" They do a good job at making
    sure you didn't have any random errors in your download, but they
    don't help you figure out whether you were downloading it from the
    attacker. The better question to answer is: "Is this file that I
    just downloaded the file that Tor intended me to get?"

    Each file on <a href="<page download/download>">our download
    page</a> is accompanied by a file with the same name as the
    package and the extension ".asc". These .asc files are GPG
    signatures. They allow you to verify the file you've downloaded
    is exactly the one that we intended you to get. For example,
    torbrowser-install-<version-torbrowserbundle>_en-US.exe is accompanied by
    torbrowser-install-<version-torbrowserbundle>_en-US.exe.asc. For a list
    of which developer signs which package, see our

    Verify the sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt file by executing this command:
    </p>
    <pre>
    > gpg.exe --verify sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt.asc sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt

    You should see a message like

    If you don't, there is a problem. Try these steps again.

    <h4>Verify the file integrity of Tor Browser</h4>
    <p>
    If you want to verify a Windows Tor Browser package you need to first
    strip off the authenticode signature of it.<br/>
    Tools that can be used for this purpose are
    <a href="http://osslsigncode.sourceforge.net">osslsigncode</a> and
    <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=416175">delcert.exe</a>.
    Assuming you have built e.g. <tt>osslsigncode</tt> on a Linux computer you can enter
    </p>
    <pre>
    > C:\path\to\osslsigncode remove-signature &#92;
        where\you\saved\\&lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.exe &lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.exe
    </pre>

    <p>Now use the sha256sum of the Tor Browser package with the
    <a href="http://md5deep.sourceforge.net/">hashdeep utility</a> and run
    </p>
    <pre>
    C:\location\of\hashdeep -c sha256sum &lt;TOR BROWSER FILE NAME&gt;.exe

     <li>You will see a string of letters and numbers.</li>

     <li>Open <tt>sha256sums-unsigned-build.txt</tt> in a text editor.</li>

     <li>Locate the name of the Tor Browser file you downloaded.</li>

     <li>
     Compare the string of letters and numbers to the left of your filename with
     the string of letters and numbers that appeared on your command line.
     If they match, you've successfully verified the build.

    <hr>
    <p>
    Starting with Tor Browser 4.5a4 we sign our MAR files which helps
    securing our update process. The downside of this is the need for additional
    instructions to verify that the MAR files we ship are indeed the ones we
    produced with our rbm setup.
    </p>
   </label>
   <article class="ac-small">
    <p>
    Assuming the verification happens on a Linux computer one first needs the
    <tt>mar-tools-linux*.zip</tt> out of the <tt>gitian-builder/inputs</tt>
    directory to remove the embedded signature(s). The steps to get the unsigned
    MAR file on a 64 bit Linux are</p>
    <pre>
    $ cd /path/to/MAR/file
    $ unzip /path/to/gitian-builder/inputs/mar-tools-linux64.zip
    $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/MAR/file/mar-tools
    $ mar-tools/signmar -r your-signed-mar-file.mar your-unsigned-mar-file.mar</pre>
    <p>Now you can compare the SHA256 sum of <tt>your-unsigned-mar-file.mar</tt>
    with the one provided in the <tt>sha265sums-unsigned-build.txt</tt> or
    <tt>sha256sums-unsigned-build.incremental.txt</tt> as outlined in
