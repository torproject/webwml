# Download Tor for Unix, Linux, BSD

## Want Tor to really work?

...then please don't just install it and go on. You need to change some of
your habits, and reconfigure your software! Tor by itself is _NOT_ all you
need to maintain your anonymity. Read the [full list of
warnings](../download/download.html.en#warning).

## What's the difference between Stable & Unstable?

Stable packages are released when we believe the features and code will not
change for many months.

Unstable packages are released so you can help us test new features and
bugfixes. Even though they have a higher version number than the stable
versions listed above, there is a much higher chance of serious reliability
and security bugs in these downloads. Please be prepared to [report
bugs](https://bugs.torproject.org/).

Tor is distributed as [Free Software](http://www.fsf.org/) under the [3-clause
BSD license](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/LICENSE).

There is no fee for installing Tor, or using the Tor network, but if you want
Tor to become faster and more usable please consider [making a tax-deductible
donation to The Tor Project](../donate/donate-download.html.en).

To keep informed of security advisories and new stable releases, subscribe to
the [tor-announce mailing list](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-
bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-announce) (you will be asked to confirm via email).
You can also [watch the list's RSS
feed](http://rss.gmane.org/gmane.network.onion-routing.announce).

If you would like to research any past release of Tor source, packages, or
other binaries, see [the archive](https://archive.torproject.org/).

If you have trouble downloading Tor from this site, here is a [list of sites
mirroring the Tor site](../getinvolved/mirrors.html.en).

For a list of what has changed in each stable Tor release, see the
[ReleaseNotes](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/ReleaseNotes?id=tor-0.3.4.8).
For a list of changes in both stable and development versions, see the
[ChangeLog](https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git/plain/ChangeLog).
