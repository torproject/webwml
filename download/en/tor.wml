<h2><a class="anchor" href="#warning">Want Tor to really work?</a></h2>
	<p>You need to change some of your habits, as some things won't work exactly as
you are used to.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Use Tor Browser</b>

<p>

Tor does not protect all of your computer's Internet traffic when you
run it. Tor only protects your applications that are properly configured to
send their Internet traffic through Tor. To avoid problems with Tor
configuration, we strongly recommend you use the
<a href="<page projects/torbrowser>">Tor Browser</a>. It is pre-configured to protect
your privacy and anonymity on the web as long as you're browsing with Tor
Browser itself. Almost any other web browser configuration is likely to be
unsafe to use with Tor.

</p>

</li>

<li><b>Don't torrent over Tor</b>
<p>
Torrent file-sharing applications have been observed to ignore proxy 
settings and make direct connections even when they are told to use Tor. 
Even if your torrent application connects only through Tor, you will 
often send out your real IP address in the tracker GET request, 
because that's how torrents work. Not only do you <a 
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea">
deanonymize your torrent traffic and your other simultaneous Tor web 
traffic</a> this way, you also slow down the entire Tor network for everyone else. 
</p>
</li>

<li><b>Don't enable or install browser plugins</b>

<p>

Tor Browser will block browser plugins such as Flash, RealPlayer,
Quicktime, and others: they can be manipulated into revealing your IP address.
Similarly, we do not recommend installing additional addons or plugins into
Tor Browser, as these may bypass Tor or otherwise harm your anonymity and
privacy.

</p>

</li>

<li><b>Use HTTPS versions of websites</b>

<p>

Tor will encrypt your traffic
<a href="<page about/overview>#thesolution">to and
within the Tor network</a>, but the encryption of your traffic to the final
destination website depends upon on that website. To help ensure private
encryption to websites, Tor Browser includes <a
href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a> to force the
use of HTTPS encryption with major websites that support it. However, you
should still watch the browser URL bar to ensure that websites you provide
sensitive information to display a
<a href="https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Site%20Identity%20Button">blue or
green URL bar button</a>, include <b>https://</b> in the URL, and display the
proper expected name for the website. Also see EFF's interactive page
explaining <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https">how Tor
and HTTPS relate</a>.

</p>

</li>

<li><b>Don't open documents downloaded through Tor while online</b>

<p>

Tor Browser will warn you before automatically opening documents that are
handled by external applications. <b>DO NOT IGNORE THIS WARNING</b>.  You
should be very careful when downloading documents via Tor (especially DOC and
PDF files, unless you use the PDF viewer that's built into Tor Browser) as
these documents can contain Internet resources that will be downloaded outside
of Tor by the application that opens them. This will reveal your non-Tor IP
address. If you must work with DOC and/or PDF files, we strongly recommend
either using a disconnected computer,
downloading the free <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> and
using it with a <a href="http://virtualboxes.org/">virtual machine image</a>
with networking disabled, or using <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>.
Under no circumstances is it safe to use
<a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea">BitTorrent
and Tor</a> together, however.

</p>

</li>

<li><b>Use bridges and/or find company</b>

<p>

Tor tries to prevent attackers from learning what destination websites you
connect to. However, by default, it does not prevent somebody watching your Internet
traffic from learning that you're using Tor. If this matters to you, you can
reduce this risk by configuring Tor to use a <a href="<page docs/bridges>">Tor
bridge relay</a> rather than connecting directly to the public Tor network.
Ultimately the best protection is a social approach: the more Tor
users there are near you and the more
<a href="<page about/torusers>">diverse</a> their interests, the less
dangerous it will be that you are one of them. Convince other people to use
Tor, too!

</p>

</li>

</ol>
<br>
<p>
Be smart and learn more. Understand what Tor does and does not offer.
This list of pitfalls isn't complete, and we need your
help <a href="<page getinvolved/volunteer>#Documentation">identifying and documenting
all the issues</a>.
