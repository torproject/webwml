## Nyx ([Project Page](https://nyx.torproject.org/))

[![Nyx bandwidth graph and
log](../images/screenshot_nyx_page1_cropped.png)](https://nyx.torproject.org/)

Nyx is a command-line monitor for Tor. With this you can get detailed real-
time information about your relay such as...

  * resource usage (bandwidth, cpu, and memory usage)
  * general relaying information (nickname, fingerprint, flags, or/dir/controlports)
  * event log with optional regex filtering and deduplication
  * connections correlated against tor's consensus data (ip, connection types, relay details, etc)

Most of Nyx's attributes are configurable through an optional
[nyxrc](https://nyx.torproject.org/#configuration) configuration file. It runs
on any platform supported by curses including Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix-
like variants. For more information **[please see its
homepage](https://nyx.torproject.org/)**.
