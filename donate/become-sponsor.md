# Sponsorship

Are you interested in furthering research into anonymous communications? Are
you concerned about the state of surveillance and lack of privacy on the
Internet today?

If so, [contact us](../about/contact.html.en) to talk more about how we can
help you and your organization.

The Tor Project is staffed by some of the top researchers in anonymous
communications, Internet circumvention and privacy. We are currently funded to
improve the state of online anonymity globally through various
[sponsors](../about/sponsors.html.en). Our [current list of
projects](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/sponsors) is
available. Please join us to further online anonymity!

## What happens to my donation?

If you've just donated, thank you for your donation. Your funds are deposited
into our general fund. You join thousands of other individual
[sponsors](../about/sponsors.html.en) in funding the future of Tor and online
anonymity.

Our [financial documents](../about/financials.html.en) are available for your
