    <h2>Legal FAQ for Tor Relay Operators</h2>
    <p>FAQ written by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (<a href="http://www.eff.org/">EFF</a>). 
      Last updated 25 Apr 2005.</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This FAQ is for informational purposes only and 
      does not constitute legal advice. EFF has not analyzed any particular factual 
      situation or laws in drafting this FAQ. Our aim is to provide a general 
      description of the legal issues surrounding Tor in the United States. Different 
      factual situations and different legal jurisdictions will result in different 
      answers to a number of questions. Therefore, please do not act on this information 
      alone; if you have any specific legal problems, issues, or questions, seek 
      a complete review of your situation with a lawyer licensed to practice in 
      your jurisdiction. </p>
    <p>Also, if you received this document from anywhere besides <a

    <a id="Lawsuits"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#Lawsuits">Has anyone ever been sued for running 
      Tor? </a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Further, we believe that running a Tor node, including 
      a Tor exit node that allows people to anonymously send and receive traffic, 
      is lawful under U.S. law.</p>
    <a id="IllegalPurposes"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#IllegalPurposes">Should I use Tor, or encourage 
      the use of Tor, for illegal purposes such as spamming, harassment, distribution 
      of child porn, or copyright infringement?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Tor has been developed to be a tool for free speech, 
      privacy, and human rights. It is not a tool designed or intended to be used 
      to break the law, either by Tor users or Tor relay operators.</p>
    <p>We further recommend that you not keep any potentially illegal files on 
      the same machine you use for Tor, nor use that machine for any illegal purpose. 
      Although no Tor relay in the US has ever been seized, nor any relay operator 
      sued, the future possibility cannot be ruled out. If that happens, you will 
      want your machine to be clean.</p>
    <a id="Promise"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#Promise">Can EFF promise that I won't get in 
      trouble for running a Tor relay?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> All new technologies create legal uncertainties, and 
      Tor is no exception to the rule. Presently, no court has ever considered 
      any case involving the Tor technology, and we therefore cannot guarantee 
      that you will never face any legal liability as a result of running a Tor 
      relay. However, EFF believes so strongly that those running Tor relays shouldn't 
      be liable for traffic that passes through the relay that we're running our 
      own Tor relay. </p>
    <a id="Represent"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#Represent">Will EFF represent me if I get in 
      trouble for running a Tor relay?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Maybe.</strong> While EFF cannot promise legal representation of 
      all Tor relay operators, it will assist relay operators in assessing the 
      situation and will try to locate qualified legal counsel when necessary. 
      Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing legal representation or referrals 
      should be directed to staff attorney Kevin Bankston (bankston at eff.org 
      or US +1 (415) 436-9333 x 126). Such inquiries will be kept confidential 
      subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege. Note that although 
      EFF cannot practice law outside of the U.S., it will still try to assist 
      non-U.S. relay operators in finding local representation.</p>
    <a id="DevelopersAreNotLawyers"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#DevelopersAreNotLawyers">Should I contact the 
      Tor developers when I have legal questions about Tor or to inform them if 
      I suspect Tor is being used for illegal purposes?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Tor's core developers, Roger Dingledine and Nick Mathewson, 
      are available to answer technical questions, but they are not lawyers and 
      cannot give legal advice. Nor do they have any ability to prevent illegal 
      activity that may occur through Tor relays. Furthermore, your communications 
      with Tor's core developers are not protected by any legal privilege, so 
      law enforcement or civil litigants could subpoena and obtain any information 
      you give to them.</p>
    <a id="RequestForLogs"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#RequestForLogs">If I receive a request from law 
      enforcement or anyone else for my Tor relay's logs, what should I do?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Educate them about Tor.</strong> In most instances, properly configured 
      Tor relays will have no useful data for inquiring parties, and you should 
      feel free to educate them on this point. To the extent you do maintain logs, 
      however, you should not disclose them to any third party without first consulting 
      a lawyer. In the U.S., such a disclosure may violate the Electronic Communications 
      Privacy Act, and relay operators outside of the U.S. may be subject to similar 
      data protection laws.</p>
    <p>You may receive legal inquiries where you are prohibited by law from telling 
      anyone about the request. We believe that, at least in the U.S., such gag 
      orders do not prevent you from talking to a lawyer, including calling a 
      lawyer to find representation. Inquiries to EFF for the purpose of securing 
      legal representation should be directed to staff attorney Kevin Bankston 
      (bankston at eff.org or US +1 (415) 436-9333 x126). Such inquiries will 
      be kept confidential subject to the limits of the attorney/client privilege.</p>
    <p>EFF is currently working on informational materials to help you respond 
      to the most likely types of legal requests or notices, so watch this space.</p>
    <a id="DMCA"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#DMCA">My ISP/University/etc just sent me a DMCA 
      notice. What should I do?</a></h3>
    <p>The EFF has written a <a
href="tor-dmca-response.html">short template</a> to help you write a response 
      to your ISP/University/etc, to let them know about the details of DMCA safe 
      harbor, and how Tor fits in. Note that this only refers to a U.S. jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>If you like, you should consider submitting a copy of your notice to <a href="http://www.chillingeffects.org/">Chilling 
      Effects</a>. This will help us recognize trends and issues that the lawyers 
      might want to focus on. Chilling Effects encourages submissions from people 
      outside the United States too.</p>
    <p>EFF is actively seeking Tor relay operators willing to stand up and help 
      set a clear legal precedent establishing that merely running a node does 
      not create copyright liability for either node operators or their bandwidth 
      providers. If you want to be the EFF's test case, <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Oct-2005/msg00208.html">read 
      more here</a>.</p>
    <a id="ExitSnooping"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#ExitSnooping">Should I snoop on the plaintext 
      that exits through my Tor relay?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> You may be technically capable of modifying the Tor 
      source code or installing additional software to monitor or log plaintext 
      that exits your node. However, Tor relay operators in the U.S. can create 
      legal and possibly even criminal liability for themselves under state or 
      federal wiretap laws if they affirmatively monitor, log, or disclose Tor 
      users' communications, while non-U.S. operators may be subject to similar 
      laws. Do not examine the contents of anyone's communications without first 
      talking to a lawyer.</p>
    <a id="DirectoryWarranty"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#DirectoryWarranty">Do Tor's core developers make 
      any promises about the trustworthiness or reliability of Tor relays that 
      are listed in their directory?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> Although the developers attempt to verify that Tor 
      relays listed in the directory the core developers maintain are stable and 
      have adequate bandwidth, neither they nor EFF can guarantee the personal 
      trustworthiness or reliability of the individuals who run those relays. 
      Tor's core developers further reserve the right to refuse a Tor relay operator's 
      request to be listed in their directory or to remove any relay from their 
      directory for any reason.</p>
    <a id="License"></a> 
    <h3><a class="anchor" href="#License">Is the Tor software subject to any license 
      terms?</a></h3>
    <p><strong>Yes.</strong> The Tor software is distributed under the Modified 
      BSD license, and is reproduced below. The Vidalia software is distributed
