  <h2>Why You Need Tor</h2>
  <p>The vast majority of Internet traffic passes along public routes, making 
    it relatively easy for prying eyes to view your comings and goings -- and 
    even link some important financial or personal information to you!</p>
  <p>Snoopers can get your information almost anywhere:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Internet service provider</li>
    <li>Your favorite website or online store</li>
    <li>Your favorite coffee shop or cafe with free wifi</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These snooping activities are commonly called traffic analysis. Corporations, 
    marketing organizations, governments, and other parties are becoming increasingly 
    sophisticated at it.</p>
  <p>Traffic Analysis enables: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Politically rigid governments to compile lists of citizens reading outlawed 
      journals</li>
    <li>Thieves, spammers, and phishers to launch progressively sophisticated and 
      personalized attacks</li>
    <li>Corporations can collect and aggregate online browsing and chatting behavior 
      for better ad-targeting and profiling.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For some people, this electronic spying is a nuisance that can affect their 
    pocketbook; for others, it jeopardizes their personal security.</p>
  <p>Since 2001, the Tor Project has been developing free and open-source software 
    that helps provide anonymity for Internet users. It works by allowing users 
    to travel the web on a circuitous route over more than 1000 servers positioned 
    around the world. When you use Tor, your route on the Internet is indirect, 
    so snoops have a difficult time following your path and seizing vital information. 
    Tor also has special functionality, called hidden services, that allows you 
    to run websites without revealing their location.</p>
  <p>Tor is compatible with different operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, 
    Apple Mac, and various versions of Linux. Tor works with most programs that 
    connect your computer to the Internet.</p>
  <p>Tor is used by hundreds of thousands of people to protect their activities 
    online:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Journalists who need to protect their sources</li>
    <li>Human rights workers</li>
    <li>Dissidents in politically rigid countries</li>
    <li>Corporations who wish to protect their employees' web traffic</li>
    <li>Whistle blowers who fear retribution</li>
    <li>Governments wishing to protect their agents' and employees' traffic</li>
    <li>Law enforcement officers on Internet sting operations</li>
    <li>People wanting to post socially sensitive information in chat rooms, like 
      rape or abuse survivors and those with stigmatized illnesses.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Tor Network also provides protection for people looking for another layer 
    of privacy from the millions of websites bent on collecting private information 
    and tracking their moves online.</p>
  <h3>Why Tor Needs You</h3>
