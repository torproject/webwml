  <p>Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a 
    form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, 
    confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known 
    as <a href="/overview.html">traffic analysis</a>.</p>
  <p>Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network 
    of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching 
    your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents 
    the sites you visit from learning your physical location. Tor works with many 
    of your existing applications, including web browsers, instant messaging clients, 
    remote login, and other applications based on the TCP protocol. </p>
  <p> Hundreds of thousands of people around the world use Tor for a wide variety 
    of reasons: journalists and bloggers, human rights workers, law enforcement 
    officers, soldiers, corporations, citizens of repressive regimes, and just 
    ordinary citizens. See the <a href="/torusers.html">Who Uses Tor?</a> page 
    for examples of typical Tor users. See the <a href="/overview.html">overview 
    page</a> for a more detailed explanation of what Tor does, and why this diversity 
    of users is important. </p>
  <p>Tor doesn't magically encrypt all of your Internet activities, though. You 
    should <a href="/download.html#Warning">understand what Tor does and does 
    not do for you</a>.</p>
  <p> Tor's security improves as its user base grows and as more people volunteer 
    to <a href="/docs/tor-doc-relay.html">run relays</a>. (It isn't nearly as 
    hard to set up as you might think, and can significantly <a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter/TorFAQ#RelayAnonymity"> 
    enhance your own security</a>.) If running a relay isn't for you, we need 
    <a href="/volunteer.html">help with many other aspects of the project</a>, 
    and we need funds to continue making the Tor network faster and easier to 
    use while maintaining good security</a>.</p>
  <p>Tor is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to allow you to 
    protect your Internet traffic from analysis. Please make a <a href="/donate.html">tax-deductible 
    donation.</a> </p>
