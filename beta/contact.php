    <h2>Tor: Contact</h2>
    <p>First, if you have a problem or question about using Tor, go look at the 
      <a href="documentation.html.en#Support">Support section</a> for how to proceed. 
      The Tor developers spend most of their time developing Tor, and there are 
      no people devoted to user support, so try to help yourself before <a
href="faq.html.en#SupportMail">politely trying to find a volunteer</a>.</p>
    <p>If you really do need to reach us, here are some approaches. All of these 
      addresses are @torproject.org. Note that in practice most of them go to 
      the same small group of people, so please be patient and <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">helpful</a>, and please 
      make sure to write your mail in English.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>tor-ops</tt> gets to the people who manage the directory authorities. 
        Use this if you run a Tor relay and have a question or problem with your 
        relay.</li>
      <li><tt>tor-webmaster</tt> can fix typos on the website, change wrong statements 
        or directions on the website, and add new sections and paragraphs that 
        you send us. You might want to make a draft of your new sections on <a href="https://wiki.torproject.org/noreply/TheOnionRouter">the 
        Tor wiki</a> first.</li>
      <li><tt>tor-volunteer</tt> wants to hear about your documents, patches, 
        testing, experiences with supporting applications, and so forth inspired 
        by our <a href="volunteer.html.en">volunteer page</a> (or other problems 
        you've fixed or documented about using Tor). There's no need to mail us 
        before you start working on something -- like all volunteer Internet projects, 
        we hear from a lot of excited people who vanish soon after, so we are 
        most interested in hearing about actual progress.</li>
      <li><tt>tor-translation</tt> can put new <a href="translation.html.en">website 
        translations</a> into place, and help answer questions about existing 
        and new translations.</li>
      <li><tt>tor-assistants</tt> is the catch-all address for press contacts 
        and other comments and issues.</li>
      <li><tt>tordnsel</tt> is the alias for the people responsible for the tordns 
        exitlist.</li>
      <li><tt>donations</tt> is for questions and comments about <a href="donate.html.en">getting 
        money to the developers</a>. More donations means <a
href="faq.html.en#Funding">more Tor</a>. We're happy to help think about creative 
        ways for you to contribute.</li>
      <li><tt>execdir</tt> is for questions and comments about Tor the non-profit 
        corporation: trademark questions, affiliation and coordination, major 
        gifts, contract inquiries, licensing and certification, etc.</li>
    </ul>
