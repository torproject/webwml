    <h2>Tor Trademark Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <a id="usage"></a> 
    <h3>How can I use the name "Tor"?</h3>
    <p>The Tor Project encourages developers to use the name Tor in ways that 
      do not confuse the public about the source of anonymity software and services. 
      If you are building open-source non-commercial software or services that 
      incorporate or work with The Tor Project's code, you may use the name “Tor” 
      in an accurate description of your work. We ask you to include a link to 
      the official Tor website <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">https://www.torproject.org/</a> 
      so users can verify the original source of Tor for themselves, and a note 
      indicating that your project is not sponsored by The Tor Project. For example, 
      “This product is produced independently from the Tor&#174; anonymity software 
      and carries no guarantee from The Tor Project about quality, suitability 
      or anything else.”</p>
    <a id="onionlogo"></a> 
    <h3>Can I use the Tor onion logo?</h3>
    <p>If you're making non-commercial use of Tor software, you may also use the 
      Tor onion logo (as an illustration, not as a brand for your products). Please 
      don't modify the design or colors of the logo. You can use items that look 
      like the Tor onion logo to illustrate a point (e.g. an exploded onion with 
      layers, for instance), so long as they're not used as logos in ways that 
      would confuse people.</p>
    <a id="combining"></a> 
    <h3>Can I use the word "Tor" as part of the name of my product or my domain 
      name?</h3>
    <p>We recommend that you don't do this, but rather find a name that will accurately 
      identify <i>your</i> products or services. Remember that our goal is to 
      make sure that people aren't confused about whether your product or project 
      is made or endorsed by The Tor Project. Creating a new brand that incorporates 
      the Tor brand is likely to lead to confusion.</p>
    <a id="enforcing"></a> 
    <h3>Does this mean you're enforcing trademark rights?</h3>
    <p>The Tor Project is a non-profit corporation organized to research and develop 
      the Tor anonymity software and network. We don't want to be trademark bullies, 
      but we will use trademark to protect the public's ability to recognize Tor 
      Project software. Trademark law helps us to assure that the name is used 
      only in connection with genuine Tor anonymity software and for accurate 
      description of software and services. After all, to protect their anonymity 
      securely, computer users must be able to identify the software they are 
      using, so they can account properly for its strengths and weaknesses. Tor 
      has become well-known as a software package and associated network of onion-routing 
      anonymizing proxies, with online documentation, instructions for strengthening 
      anonymity protection, and warnings that even at this stage it remains experimental 
      software. We work with developers to improve the software and network and 
      actively encourage researchers to document attacks to help us strengthen 
      its anonymity protection further. We distribute the software itself freely, 
      but require correct attribution. </p>

    <h3>What if I produce non-open source, commercial products based on Tor?</h3>
    <p>Contact us, and let's talk.</p>
    <a id="licensee"></a> 
    <h3>Are there official licensees of the Tor trademarks?</h3>
