# A few things everyone can do now:

  1. Please consider [running a relay](../docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en) to help the Tor network grow.
  2. Tell your friends! Get them to run relays. Get them to run onion services. Get them to tell their friends.
  3. If you like Tor's goals, please [take a moment to donate to support further Tor development](../donate/donate.html.en). We're also looking for more sponsors -- if you know any companies, NGOs, agencies, or other organizations that want anonymity / privacy / communications security, let them know about us.
  4. We're looking for more [good examples of Tor users and Tor use cases](../about/torusers.html.en). If you use Tor for a scenario or purpose not yet described on that page, and you're comfortable sharing it with us, we'd love to hear from you.

## Documentation

  1. Help translate the  documentation into other languages. See the [translation guidelines](../getinvolved/translation.html.en) if you want to help out. We especially need Arabic or Farsi translations, for the many Tor users in censored areas.
  2. Evaluate and document [our list of programs](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorifyHOWTO) that can be configured to use Tor.
  3. We have a huge list of [potentially useful programs that interface with Tor](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/SupportPrograms). Which ones are useful in which situations? Please help us test them out and document your results.

## Advocacy

  1. The tor community uses [public mailing lists](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo) and IRC channels ([join via Tor](https://www.oftc.net/Tor/)), like [tor-talk](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-talk) ([#tor on irc.oftc.net](irc://irc.oftc.net/tor)), [tor-relays](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-relays) ([#tor-relays](irc://irc.oftc.net/tor-relays)), [tor-dev](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tor-dev) ([#tor-dev](irc://irc.oftc.net/tor-dev)), or [tbb-dev](https://lists.torproject.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/tbb-dev), and summarize noteworthy changes into articles for our blog and [newsletter](https://newsletter.torproject.org/).
  2. Create a presentation that can be used for various user group meetings around the world.
  3. Create a video about the positive uses of Tor, what Tor is, or how to use it. Some have already started on [Tor's Media server](https://media.torproject.org/video/), [Howcast](http://www.howcast.com/videos/90601-How-To-Circumvent-an-Internet-Proxy/), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheTorProject).
  4. Create a poster around a theme, such as "Tor for Freedom!"
  5. Create a t-shirt design that incorporates "[Congratulations! You are using Tor!](https://check.torproject.org/)" in any language.
  6. Spread the word about Tor at a symposium or conference and use these [Tor brochures](https://media.torproject.org/misc/2015-03-tor-brochure/) in PDF and ODG format and translated to at least ten different languages as conversation starter.

## Projects

Below are a list of Tor related projects we're developing and/or maintaining.

## Project Ideas

You may find some of these projects to be good ideas for [Google Summer of
Code](../about/gsoc.html.en) or the Tor Summer of Privacy. We have labelled
each idea with which of our [core developers](../about/corepeople.html.en)
would be good mentors. If one or more of these ideas looks promising to you,
please [contact us](mailto:tor-sop@lists.torproject.org) to discuss your plans
rather than sending blind applications. You may also want to propose your own
project idea -- which often results in the best applications.

  1. **Remove metadata from Tor Browser uploads**   
Likely Mentors: _Arthur D. Edelstein (arthuredelstein)_

Tor Browser is a privacy-preserving web browser used by millions of users
around the world. We are looking for a programmer fluent in JS and C++ to
implement new features to work closely with the Tor Browser team.

Image files, especially photos taken by smartphones, often carry hidden
privacy-violating metadata, typically specified by the EXIF format. Such
metadata can include the user's geolocation and various unique identifiers. In
order to protect the user's identity, we would like the intern to modify the
file-upload feature in Tor Browser such that metadata in image files is
automatically removed before the image is uploaded to a server. Ideally, the
summer intern would implement this feature for both desktop and mobile Tor
Browser. If there is time, we can envision sanitizing other kinds of uploaded
files, including movies, audio, PDFs and Office documents.

For more information [see its
ticket](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/24965). Please also
see [the Metadata Anonymisation Toolkit (MAT)](https://mat.boum.org) for a
similar project that could serve as inspiration.

  2. **Python Tor Client**   
Language: _Python_  
Likely Mentors: _Damian (atagar), teor_  
  

**[Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/)** is our Python implementation of Tor's
varous protocols. Traditionally this included
[stem.control](https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/the_little_relay_that_could.html)
for Tor's
[ControlPort](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/control-spec.txt)
and
[stem.descriptor](https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/mirror_mirror_on_the_wall.html)
to download from Tor's
[DirPort](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt). But
recently we added a third to this family,
**[stem.client](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-
dev/2018-February/012905.html)** , that speaks Tor's [ORPort
protocol](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/tor-spec.txt): the
relay protocol for usage of the Tor network itself.

This opens interesting opportunities we've never had before such as...

    * Construct a full three-hop circuit that can make GET requests and DNS lookups. If done right this might allow simple usage of the Tor network without even having Tor installed!
    * Expand [descriptor downloading](https://stem.torproject.org/tutorials/mirror_mirror_on_the_wall.html#where-can-i-get-the-current-descriptors) to use Tor's ORPort as an optional alternative for the DirPort. Following this we could adjust Tor so [Fallback Directories no longer require a DirPort](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/19129).
    * Download hidden service descriptors. Unlike relays, the descriptors for hidden services are only available over the ORPort. Once [ticket 17945](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/17945) is merged v3 HS descriptor downloads will require a multi-hop circuit. This requires an understanding of Tor's [hidden service](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/rend-spec-v3.txt) specifications, particularly the HSDir hash ring.
    * Authenticate our ORPort connection, checking that ORPorts we connect to have the right key fingerprint.
    * Add protocol level integration test of Tor's ORPort, for instance exercising edge cases in circuit construction and extension.
    * Connect to a hidden service to check if it's up or not.

And more! Applicants are encouraged to get a decent understanding of [Tor's
ORPort protocol](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/tor-spec.txt)
and come up with ideas of their own for neat directions that we can take this.
To be clear this is **not** a particularly easy beginner project as it
involves expanding stem.client to support more of Tor's ORPort protocol and
crypto.

**As part of applying for this project please get your hands wet with the
codebase by contributing some patches
for[Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/faq.html#how-do-i-get-started)!**

  3. **Fuzzing coverage of Tor**   
Likely Mentors: _Nick (nickm), ahf, teor_  
  

Starting in 0.3.0.x, Tor supports a few fuzzing systems to check our code for
bugs. But as of now, we only support a few possible entry points to Tor. It
would be great to add fuzzing support for more of our codebase -- ideally to
include our whole network-facing interface. That way, we could find more bugs
in our code faster, and fix them before they can get out of hand.

This won't be so easy, however: to fuzz effectively, we need to refactor or
mock the target function so that it doesn't change any global state, or verify
any signatures, or take too long to run. With lots of our network code, that's
not so easy. Make sure you understand how our mocking system works, and what
the challenges are, before you apply for this one.

  4. **Relay crypto parallelism**   
Likely Mentors: _Isis, Nick (nickm)_  
  

Tor relays spend a lot of time encrypting and decrypting relay traffic, doing
SHA1 and AES-CTR operations. But right now, all of this is done in the main
thread! It would be cool to split this across multiple cores instead.

This won't be so easy though. The code today is written to expect immediate
results from its encryption operations, so you would need to do some pretty
tricky refactoring in order get performance and correctness here. Make sure
you understand how circuit crypto is invoked today, and what the challenges
are, before you apply for this one.

For more information [see its
ticket](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/1749).

  5. **Anonymous local count statistics**   
Likely Mentors: _Nick (nickm), teor_  
  

There are some places in Tor where we count things (like distinct IPs) to
later report anonymized statistics. But if the local Tor instance were
compromised, this data would be exposed. There are statistical methods which
insteasd allow us to record this data in a way that's already anonymous,
before we ever summarize it. Interested?

For more information [see its
ticket](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/7532).

  6. **Improved SOCKS5 variant**   
Likely Mentors: _Nick (nickm), David Goulet (dgoulet), meejah_  
  

In proposal 229, we describe a bunch of additional SOCKS extensions that Tor-
aware applications could use to get more fine-grained control over how Tor
handles their streams. It would be cool to implement this! If there's time
remaining, you might want to add support to one or more applications. Or maybe
to torsocks?

For more information [see its
ticket](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/12456).

  7. **Onion service crypto parallelism**   
Likely Mentors: _Nick (nickm), David Goulet (dgoulet)_  
  

Onion services, onion service clients, onion service directories, and
introduction points all need to do a few public-key operations as they
operate. But right now, these operations are all done on the main thread. It
would be good to have these run across multiple cores.

This could probably be done in a way similar to how we currently handle
circuit extension handshakes in onion.c and cpuworker.c, but we'd need to
extend the state machine for onion services to add an additional state. It
could help onion services operate much more efficiently.

For more information [see its
ticket](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/13738).

  8. **Support all kinds of DNS in Tor**   
Likely Mentors: _Nick (nickm), George (asn)_  
  

Right now Tor can query for the kind of DNS information you'd find in A
records, AAAA records, and PTR records. It would be neat to be able to support
more general DNS queries to allow things like MX loopups, DNSSEC lookups, and
so on. We have a design proposal (number 219) for this, but it might need some
clean-up.

  9. **Improve IPv6 support**   
Likely Mentors: _ahf, teor_  
  

Tor works over IPv6, but require some manual configuration. Clients and relays
could automatically detect IPv6 availability, and configure themselves
appropriately. Implementing a "happy eyeballs"-like algorithm is a challenge
in an anonymity network: are you up for it?

  10. **Ahmia - Onion Service Search**   
Language: _Python, Django_  
Likely Mentors: _Juha Nurmi (numes), George (asn)_

Ahmia is open-source search engine software for Tor onion service deep dark
web sites. You can test the running search engine at ahmia.fi. For more
information see our [blog post about Ahmia's GSoC2014
development](https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/ahmiafi).

Ahmia is a working search engine that indexes, searches, and catalogs content
published on Tor Onion Services. Furthermore, it is an environment to share
meaningful insights, statistics, insights, and news about the Tor network
itself. In this context, there is a lot of work to do.

The Ahmia web service is written using the Django web framework. As a result,
the server-side language is Python. On the client-side, most of the pages are
plain HTML. There are some pages that require JavaScript, but the search
itself works without client-side JavaScript.

  11. **Bring up new ideas!**   
Don't like any of these? Look at the [Tor development
roadmap](/press/presskit/2008-12-19-roadmap-full.pdf) for more ideas, or just
try out Tor and Tor Browser, and find out what you think needs fixing. Some of
the [current
proposals](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals) might
also be short on developers.
