# Tor Translation Guidelines

* * *

If you want to help translate the Tor tools and documentation into other
languages, here are some guidelines to help you do this as efficiently as
possible.

If you would like to help translate other Tor project related information,
please visit our [Translation Overview](../getinvolved/translation-
overview.html.en) for a clear overview of what needs translation help.

Note that even if you can't translate many pages for your language, a few
pages will still be helpful. Also, rather than just translating each page word
by word, please try to translate the ideas so they make the most sense in your
language.
