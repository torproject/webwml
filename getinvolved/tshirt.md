# Tor: T-shirt for Contributing

* * *

You can get one of these fine Tor T-shirts for contributing to the Tor
project. There are two primary ways of contributing:

  1. Operate a fast [Tor relay](../docs/tor-doc-relay.html.en) that's been running for the past two months: you are eligible if you allow exits to port 80 and you average 250 KBytes/s traffic, or if you're not an exit but you average 500 KBytes/s traffic.
  2. Help out in [other ways](../getinvolved/volunteer.html.en). [Maintain a translation](../getinvolved/translation.html.en). Write a good [support program and get a lot of people to use it](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/SupportPrograms). Do research on Tor and anonymity, solve some of [our bugs](https://bugs.torproject.org/), or establish yourself as a Tor advocate. 

If you're operating a fast relay or you've done something else cool, email us
at tshirt@torproject.org with the details. (We want to make sure our shirts
help outreach happen all around the world, so please understand if we can't
send you 5 shirts for your 5 excellent relays.)

There are a [variety of colors, shapes, and
sizes](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/CommunityTeam/Tshirts)
available in the great roots design that Leiah Jansen made for us, as well as
some older designs.

In the past, you could choose between the traditional [black](../images/black-
tor-tshirt.png) and our [conversation-starting bright green](../images/green-
tor-tshirt.png). We'll bring those shirts back one day too.

You can see the shirts [in
action](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorShirt) -- add
your own photos there too.
