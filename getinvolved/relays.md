# Join the Tor Network

* * *

We created a video with [Tactical Tech](https://www.tacticaltech.org/) to help
understand why being a relay matters ([HD
version](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
english.ogv)). It is translated into
[Arabic](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
arabic.ogv),
[Farsi](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
farsi.ogv),
[German](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
german.ogv), [Mandarin
Chinese](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
mandarin.ogv), and
[Spanish](https://media.torproject.org/video/2012-03-04-BuildingBridges-HD-
spanish.ogv)

The Tor network relies on volunteers to donate bandwidth. The more people who
run Tor as a relay or a bridge, the faster and safer the network becomes.

# Two ways to join and help out

* * *

## Run it yourself

You can run Tor as either a relay or a bridge. A bridge will usually see less
traffic than a relay, and will only be the first hop in the three hop circuit.

You can find instructions on how to configure a relay in the [Tor Relay
Guide](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/TorRelayGuide).
Instructions for [bridges](../docs/bridges.html.en#RunningABridge).

## Donate to others to run for you

[Torservers](https://www.torservers.net/), [Noisetor](https://noisetor.net/),
and [Nos Oignons](https://nos-oignons.net) will turn your donation into Tor
exit relays.
